                            Judy graduated from Wayne State University in May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and is 
                            currently a software developer for Nexient since October 2017. Much of her work thus far has 
                            been on back-end development and working with legacy applications, with proficiency in C++ and 
                            competence in several other languages and technologies. Judy is always looking for ways to

                            capturing, analyzing, and decrypting Bluetooth packets.

                            Microservices are all the rage these days. Docker and containers have completely changed how we

                            and how to build a python API with docker.
