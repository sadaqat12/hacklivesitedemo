                            Imagine a productivity hub that helps you manage your calendar (Calendar API), reminds you of unfinished 
                            tasks (To Do API), connects you with people you work frequently with (People). You can join your online 
                            classes with one click to open Microsoft Teams (onlineMeeting). You can even add bots to help manage 
                            notifications about COVID-19. <br><br>What about building an app to help manage remote learning classrooms 
                            (education APIs)? You can create breakout sessions for smaller group discussions (Teams API), access 
                            files shared among your group (Files API), assign tasks for members to complete, retrieve sections of 
                            information from OneNote notebook (OneNote API), and more! <br><br>What if I tell you that Microsoft Graph can 
                            also be used to help solve one of the biggest challenges facing security professionals today – connecting 
                            the diverse ecosystem of security solutions to improve the speed and accuracy of cyber defense. You would 
                            have the opportunity to directly solve that challenge with the Microsoft Graph Security API today. <br><br>
                            All of the above can be enabled through Microsoft Graph. The possibilities are endless! With unified API access 
                            to these services in the Microsoft 365 suite, you can now consume data through a single public endpoint 
                            (<a href="https://graph.microsoft.com">https://graph.microsoft.com</a>) - Using simple REST calls or with an SDK available on about any platform. 
                            Authentication models are standardized. Permissions are secure, granted using OAuth protocols.

                            Build a data-driven application that enables individual car owners to maximize the useful value of 
                            their mobility investment. Keep in mind that “value” is deliberately left up to your team to define. 
                            It could mean extending the lifetime of a vehicle so you can drive it hundreds of thousands of miles. 
                            Cars often sit in parking lots, so perhaps your team will choose to deal with fully utilizing the 
                            transportation potential of your vehicle. Maybe you can use driving data to predict the inflection 
                            point in maintenance costs in order to trade in your vehicle for a brand-new one. There are plenty of 
                            other options to explore. Spend some time brainstorming “why” you want to maximize a particular value 
                            before you implement “how” you will do so!

                            in the area they are living or looking to buy a home or business. This might include things like 
                            crime and/or weather patterns such as tornadoes, hail, floods, large destructive storms, climate 
                            change trends, and/or other natural disasters. Using this data, the potential property owners/buyers 
                            could better understand the risks they are taking now and (perhaps) in the future. This could help 
                            them compare two or more properties and choose the one that is more suited for them. This could also

                            vast network is no small effort, and AEP has been experimenting with computer vision to better
                             map and understand the network. Build a web or mobile application that uses the provided images,
                              metadata and utility pole object detection model to better manage AEP’s distribution network.

                            Build a supply chain optimization app. There are millions of trucks on the roads, everyday delivering loads 
                            to companies and making home deliveries. The trucking industry can even be considered a mobile warehouse
                             for many large companies. Traffic, pollution, and serious risks to private motorists are just some of 
                             the topics that bubble to the top when considering this multibillion-dollar industry. But it is also 
                             an industry at the very beginning of a digital disruption. Digital load boards and freight 
                             marketplaces have been created. Uber and Amazon have jumped into the supply chain game. There are 
                             many big brains, including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Al Gore contributing time and money to make
                              this industry better. For this challenge, pick one of the following aspects of the supply chain 
                              to address with a digital solution: 1. Reducing environmental impact (reducing emissions, fuel, etc.) 
                              2. Reducing shipping costs to companies and customers 3. Faster delivery times 4. Any gained 
                              efficiencies in the end-to-end process of moving freight from point A to B
