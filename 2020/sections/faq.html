            What is a hackathon?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A hackathon is an event that usually ranges from a few hours to a few days where participants work together
            to design, build, and present a project. This hackathon is a 24-hour event.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            What if I have no programming experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
            That’s okay! One of the goals of a hackathon is to learn new skills, and we will have mentors available to
            help you throughout your project. We will also host workshops prior to the hackathon to introduce you to new
            programming languages and/or tools.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Do I need to have an idea beforehand?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nope! Many participants come up with an idea at the hackathon. Challenges presented by our sponsors will be
            released the day-of, which also spark idea formation.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Can I work on my project before this event?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The spirit of a hackathon is to see what you can accomplish in one weekend. Although we will not prevent
            students from entering with pre-built components, if you enter you project for judging we ask that you are
            honest and transparent with the judges about what and how much was accomplished during HackOHI/O.
